<!-- ## Investigating uncertainty associated with the Great Lakes water balance using the Large Lake Statistical Water Balance Model 
- Worked alongside the US Army Corps of Engineers to improve upon the current and standard Bayesian model used to validate hydroclimate data over the Great Lakes
- Integrated the stage-fall-discharge equations and assimilated the latest water level data into the model, then compared and evaluated streamflow and other water balance parameter estimates -->

<!-- ## Improving the representation of groundwater in foundational Great Lakes hydrologic and hydrodynamic models and datasets
- Investigated the importance of groundwater representation in existing lake physics models with support from the US Geological Survey
- Modeled an integrated hydrologic Groundwater and Surface-water FLOW by coupling a land-surface hydrological Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System with the MODFLOW groundwater flow modeling platform
- Applied the FloPy Python package to post-process model results and observed differences in the predictions of baseflow and overall streamflow -->

<!-- ## Gelman site 1,4-dioxane groundwater contamination plume modeling and forecasting 
- Analyzed previous dioxane concentration and evaluated trends for 245 sampling wells in R
- Developed a groundwater contamination forecasting model within the Gelman plume concentration using an automated time-series machine learning package in Python
- Built a web-based interactive visualization application to allow quantification of dioxane contamination analytical data -->

<!-- ## Assessing uncertainty and impacts of climate change in historical estimates of the Great Lakes water balance
- Identified and analyzed currently available estimates of the monthly Great Lakes historical water balance from 1950 to 2020 and documented uncertainty in each water balance component
- Attributed water balance component changes to regional climate patterns and assessed the impact of climate change on future water budgets
- Prepared a summary report that is utilized as a scientific basis for the *“Cumulative Impact Assessment of Withdrawals, Consumptive Uses, and Diversions”* report and presented results to the Conference of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers -->
