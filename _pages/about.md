Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Yifan Luo. I recently graduated with an M.S. in Environment and Sustainability, specializing in Ecosystem Science and Management and Geospatial Data Sciences at the University of Michigan (UMich). Before my Master’s degree, I completed my B.S. degrees in Forest Sciences from the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Biotechnology at Beijing Forestry University. I speak Mandarin, English, German, and Japanese. I have experience with hydrological and groundwater modeling, programming in R and Python, data assimilation and machine learning, spatio-temporal statistical analysis, GIS and remote sensing, large data analysis skills, and high-performance computing. 

My research interests lie in studying the interdisciplinary science of hydrology that incorporates methods and theories from water resource management, ecosystem science, climate systems, and environmental justice. I am particularly interested in seeking a better understanding of the fundamental hydrological and climatic processes and mechanisms and their mutual interactions governing the water and energy cycles over a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding them is critical to the solution of critical environmental issues such as:
(1) the assessment of regional and global impact on the sustainability of water resources due to climate change, increasing water demand, changes in water management practices, etc;
(2) the uncertainty associated with water balance components in predicting natural hazard impacts on human welfare;
(3) the influence of any land surface property alteration and climate change on regional hydroclimatology, and vice versa, the feedback of changing hydrological regimes on the regional climate.

Outside of academics, I enjoy road trips, films, board games, music, and photography. I also spend a lot of my time dreaming about having a cat one day. To get in touch, please find my contact information below.
