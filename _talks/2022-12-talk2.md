Paulson, H., **Luo, Y**. Climate Change and Great Lakes Basin Water Management. American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting. December 2022. (Poster)

The Laurentian Great Lakes System is a unique and irreplaceable freshwater resource. To support political decision making surrounding consumptive water use, water availability, and shoreline management, we present a comprehensive model that successfully recreates historical water balance trends in the Great Lakes. We use this model to understand how precipitation, evaporation, runoff, groundwater seepage, and outflow from each of Great Lakes affects the water availability of the the entire system. We discuss how this model will be used to inform management decisions and allow us to prepare for unprecedented high water, low water, and anything in between.
