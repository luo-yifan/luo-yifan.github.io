title: "Investigating uncertainty associated with the Great Lakes water balance using the Large Lake Statistical Water Balance Model"
collection: publications
permalink: /project/proj1
# excerpt: 'The Laurentian Great Lakes represent the largest system of lakes on Earth, and contain roughly 20% of all the world's fresh surface water.  Our team leads research aimed at understanding short- and long-term changes in Great Lakes water level variability, including pathways through which climate change impacts the major components of the Great Lakes water balance.  This research extends into other Great Lakes regional projects, including model and dataset development for water quantity and quality management.'

The Laurentian Great Lakes represent the largest system of lakes on Earth, and contain roughly 20% of all the world's fresh surface water.  Our team leads research aimed at understanding short- and long-term changes in Great Lakes water level variability, including pathways through which climate change impacts the major components of the Great Lakes water balance.  This research extends into other Great Lakes regional projects, including model and dataset development for water quantity and quality management.

- Worked alongside the US Army Corps of Engineers to improve upon the current and standard Bayesian model used to validate hydroclimate data over the Great Lakes
- Integrated the stage-fall-discharge equations and assimilated the latest water level data into the model, then compared and evaluated streamflow and other water balance parameter estimates
